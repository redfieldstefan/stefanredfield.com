        Every day Im going to try and make something, we'll see how goes but the
        point is to start not be perfect.
      </p>
      <p>
        I feel like I don't get to play around with design or libraries as a
        part of my daily job, and honestly this skillset is one of the most fun
        ones someone could have. Its a lot of work, there's a lot to think
        about, but exploring little things every day is one of the only ways
        I've every made progress on something.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of this will be ugly, its almost the point, my dream would be to
        timebox each page to 30 minutes and that doesn't yield much you know?
      </p>
      <p>
        in this one maybe I'll try and find the text and make it ada compliant
        compared to its background
      </p>
      <p>
        Update: it took a couple days, maybe we can speed future ones along but
        I got some webpack stuff set up at least that will help in the future
      </p>
